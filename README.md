# Using ChatGPT created a chatbot for specific Data

In this project we building a query solver chatbot for a specific data using Gen AI. This is a basic query. Here data is first saved on pinecone. Pinecone is a vector database and we have used pinecone to save vectors of data. 
we are using semantic search in the begining to find the relavant responses from the database. Further that data is added into prompt and shared with gpt 3.5 to generated Answer out of it. 
To run this script you need open ai api key, pinecone api key, pinecone environment and pinecone index
Instead of pinecone normal excel containing data vector can also be used. 
Feel free to share your opinion.

Happy learning :)
